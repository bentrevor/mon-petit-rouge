> "I didn't want the hounds to tear him apart, but they were ravenous and howling for the hunt.  The day of the hunt, I got up before dawn to see mon petit rouge. He was shivering in his cage.  I opened the door, and I let him run free in the barn.  The hounds could hear him, and they could smell him.  They were going crazy."

> "I opened the barn door, and he seemed to smile at me, and then he ran away.  The hounds were very furious.  I wanted to ride after him before the hunters came, so I saddled up Mirage and we raced over the hills.  But then something startled him, and he shied before the jump, and he tripped, and we fell together."
